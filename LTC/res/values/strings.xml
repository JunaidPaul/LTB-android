    Be patient with GPS - it may take a few seconds to find your position.
    Only GPS is supported - Google\'s location service is not accurate enough, especially in areas with lots of stops like downtown.

    <h2>Update Bus Data</h2>
    <p>
    LTC routes vary between weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays (that is, some buses call at different stops or in different
    directions). Therefore the app works best if it can update the database on each type of day. If you only
    ever take the bus on a weekday, you can safely ignore Saturdays and Sundays.
    </p>
    <p>
    Updating routes takes around 20 seconds. Adding stop locations takes several minutes, which is
    why it\'s optional. If you do not
    download locations then you cannot find nearby stops.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    If all of the downloads are older than the age limit, an update is <em>required</em>, and you must
    update the database before you can check bus times.
    </li>
    <li>
    If today\'s update is older than the age limit, but another update is younger,
    an update is <em>recommended</em>. You should probably update the database, but
    you may press the back key and check bus times. The app will keep annoying you
    about it, though.
    </li>
    <li>
    If today\'s update is younger than the age limit, an update is <em>not required</em>.
