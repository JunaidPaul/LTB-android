    <h2>List of Stops</h2>
    <p>
    If GPS is enabled and you downloaded stop locations, you can choose between \"Favourites\"
    (stops you\'ve checked recently) and \"Nearby\" (stops close to you).
    Otherwise, you just get \"Favourites\".
    </p>
    <p>
    Be patient with GPS - it may take a few seconds to find your position.
    Only GPS is supported - Google\'s location service is not accurate enough, especially in areas with lots of stops like downtown.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each stop also shows which route numbers stop in which directions.
    Tap a stop to show the next arrivals for all routes.
    </p>
    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <p>
    Enter text or numbers to narrow down which stop you want (still listed Favourites-first or Nearby-first, as above).
    If the search is only digits, it matches both stop numbers (on the blue signs)
    and stops containing numbers (e.g. \"1102 Jalna NB\"). If there are any non-digits,
    it just matches stop names.
    </p>
    <p>
    Case is ignored, and multiple, partial words work. For example to find stops at Dundas and Richmond, try
    \"dun rich\".

    <h2>Update Database</h2>
    <p>
    LTC routes vary between weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays (that is, some buses call at different stops or in different
    directions). Therefore the app works best if it can update the database on each type of day. If you only
    ever take the bus on a weekday, you can safely ignore Saturdays and Sundays.
    </p>
    <p>
    Downloading routes takes around 20 seconds. Adding stop locations takes several minutes, which is
    why it\'s optional. If you do not
    download locations then you cannot find nearby stops.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    If all of the downloads are older than the age limit, an update is <em>required</em>, and you must
    update the database before you can check bus times.
    </li>
    <li>
    If today\'s download is older than the age limit, but another download is younger,
    an update is <em>recommended</em>. You should probably update the database, but
    you may press the back key and check bus times. The app will keep annoying you
    about it, though.
    </li>
    <li>
    If today\'s download is younger than the age limit, an update is <em>not required</em>.
